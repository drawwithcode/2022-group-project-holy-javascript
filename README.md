### Project idea

The user can see a visual translation of audio volume into a shape and colour representation. There are two languages : the one which is understandable by the computer, and the one which is understandable by humans. The concept ov "VOLUME" is to show the translation of these two languages by interacting with the device.

### Speculative fantasy

Our project is designed in order to be understandable by humans. By the way, it speculates on some possible and futurible (but not scientifically proven) ways of translating the concept of volume. It aims to speculate, in order to linger on the  machines which we use, and on their inner calculations.

### Devices

Given the minimalistic quality of the project, we decided to design it for mobile and laptop use. Everybody uses mobile all the time, so we thought that the easiest and more coherent access point would be the mobile device. Also, the microphone input is the main engine of the interaction, and not on every other device the microphone is present.
